General FAQ - LAN Party Setup Guide (Quakecon v.2023)
by Michael "DeusEx" OHara

Step 1 - Windows!

 If you're bringing a PC; Try to follow the flow for installing your OS if you're doing a clean Windows install before the con:
 OS → Updates (Windows 11 downloads these automatically typically before first system use) → Hardware Drivers → Browser → Misc Software (Spotify/Discord) → Games
 
 NTLite is now recommended over Macrium Reflect to help minimize downtime for Windows installs.

 Step 2 - Games!
 
 If you are doing a clean install of your games before the con, it normally goes in this order:
 Distribution Service → Games → Mods (where applicable). Most game launchers will have dedicated verification, repair, and install location tools, with the Epic Games Launcher having current support for these items on a per-game basis. For consoles, it's a much simpler process.

 Step 3 - Getting Your PC/Console To the Con and Securing It!

Here are some personal tips that I can recommend:

For Quakecon 2023, your PC/console and monitor will be tagged with a as yet-unknown system that will be registered to each attendee. More info as this develops.

If you plan on bringing either a laptop or a gaming console, please make sure there is a spot on the device for a Kensington Lock. The tables at the BYOC should still support this security method.

Please lock your computer while you are away/put your console in sleep mode (and please add a login pin to the console!), and take your XBox/Playstation controllers with you. If you don't, your screen saver (or game dashboard) will almost certainly have some form of dubious content on it. You have been warned. 

In regards to Internet, the event will provide a internet connection; but an Ethernet cord of at least 50ft and of CAT6 quality or better should be in your belongings. (length of cable has not been confirmed yet as of 04/22/2023 per event staff)

Make friends on the same row as you and toss them a Bawls or two if you want them to look after your belongings. You know, the whole squeaky wheel gets the grease kinda thing ...


 Step 4 - Something is Fucked. Literally.

 Say it with me everybody:
 “If it works before you left for Quakecon, there’s a chance it’ll stop working during Quakecon.”

 Due to Quakecon 2023 not having a Exhibit Hall; there is a Micro Center located in Richardson, about 20-25 minutes away by car with little/no traffic. To get there, you’ll exit the Gaylord onto TX-26, then merge onto I-635 Eastbound. You’ll exit onto 75 North, and you’ll be on Northbound 75 for a couple mins; and take the Spring Valley exit (Exit 23). U-Turn onto the service road for 75 South, and you’ll see Micro Center on your right-hand side.

 Step 5 - Cleaning your PC

 A couple of weeks before the con, and again before you tear down your PC to bring it to the con, make sure to give it a good cleaning! (Also, clean your mouse and keyboard; you filthy monsters **FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S HOLY**). The PC cleaning can generally be accomplished with either an ESD-free vacuum or a leaf blower. If you use the leaf blower though, make sure to keep your case fans from spinning; otherwise, you will put a lot of unnecessary wear on them, leading to them potentially failing during a gaming session at the con.


 Step 6 - Entering the BYOC

 You will be asked to open your bags/purses upon entering the BYOC to inspect for any dangerous items by event security. This team, along with uniformed and plain-clothes deputies from the Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office want to keep all attendees safe. Bottom line, use common sense when packing any bags to bring into the BYOC area.
