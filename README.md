General FAQ - LAN Party Setup Guide (Quakecon v.2023)
by Michael "DeusEx" OHara

Step 1 - Windows!

 If you're bringing a PC; Try to follow the flow for installing your OS if you're doing a clean Windows install before the con:
 OS → Updates (Windows 11 downloads these automatically typically before first system use) → Hardware Drivers → Browser → Misc Software (Spotify/Discord) → Games
 
 NTLite is now recommended over Macrium Reflect to help minimize downtime for Windows installs.

For consoles/handhelds, make sure your system firmware is up to date, and all major patches for your games have been downloaded. You do want to spend most of your time gaming right, not downloading patches or full game installs *I hope*?

 Step 2 - Games!
 
 If you are doing a clean install of your games before the con, it normally goes in this order:
 Distribution Service → Games → Mods (where applicable). Most game launchers will have dedicated verification, repair, and install location tools, with the Epic Games Launcher having current support for these items on a per-game basis. For consoles, it's a much simpler process.

 Step 3 - Getting Your PC/Console To the Con and Securing It!

Here are some personal tips that I can recommend:

For Quakecon 2023, your PC/console and monitor will be tagged with a similar system as used in previous years (95% sure this is the case, but event staff have not officially confirmed that the old registration system is indeed returning)

If you plan on bringing either a laptop or a gaming console, please make sure there is a spot on the device for a Kensington Lock. The tables at the BYOC should still support this security method.

Please lock your computer while you are away/put your console in sleep mode (and please add a login pin to the console!), and take your XBox/Playstation/Nintendo Switch controllers/handhelds with you when you leave the BYOC for the night. If you don't, your screen saver (or game dashboard) will almost certainly have some form of dubious content on it. You have been warned. 

In regards to Internet, the event will provide a internet connection; but an Ethernet cord of at least 50ft and of CAT5 quality or better should be in your belongings. (length of cable has not been confirmed yet as of 06/01/2023 per event staff)

Make friends on the same row as you and toss them a Bawls or two if you want them to look after your belongings. You know, the whole squeaky wheel gets the grease kinda thing ...


 Step 4 - Something is Fucked. Literally.

 Say it with me everybody:
 “If it works before you left for Quakecon, there’s a chance it’ll stop working during Quakecon.”

 Due to Quakecon 2023 not having a Exhibit Hall; for PC parts/cheap HDMI cables and the like; there is a Micro Center located in Richardson, about 20-25 minutes away by car with little/no traffic. To get there, you’ll exit the Gaylord onto TX-26, then merge onto I-635 Eastbound. You’ll exit onto 75 North, and you’ll be on Northbound 75 for a couple mins; and take the Spring Valley exit (Exit 23). U-Turn onto the service road for 75 South, and you’ll see Micro Center on your right-hand side. 

For console peripherals, you have a couple of choices; both of which are approximately 15 minutes away by car. The first is the Gamestop @ Grapevine Mills Mall, located at Entry 5. To get here, you'll exit the Gaylord to the left onto TX-26; and TX-26 dead ends into Grapevine Mills Mall. To get to Gamestop, you'll want to take a left onto Grapevine Mills Trail, then a right onto E Grapevine Mills Circle. The nearest parking is the same as for the AMC Theater located in the mall. The second is Best Buy, which is located off of TX-114. From the Gaylord, you'll make a right onto Ruth Wall Rd, then another right onto TX-114. You'll make two more lefts, one onto Ball St, and the second onto Ira E Woods Ave. You'll go underneath the TX-114 overpass and Best Buy is in the shopping center near the overpass.

 Step 5 - Cleaning your PC/Console

 A couple of weeks before the con, and again before you tear down your PC to bring it to the con, make sure to give it a good cleaning! (Also, clean your mouse and keyboard; you filthy monsters **FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S HOLY**). The PC cleaning can generally be accomplished with either an ESD-free vacuum or a leaf blower. If you use the leaf blower though, make sure to keep your case fans from spinning; otherwise, you will put a lot of unnecessary wear on them, leading to them potentially failing during a gaming session at the con. For consoles, make sure to wipe the exterior down with a disinfectant wipe before transporting.


 Step 6 - Entering the BYOC

 You will be asked to open your bags/purses upon entering the BYOC to inspect for any dangerous items by event security. This team, along with uniformed and plain-clothes deputies from the Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office want to keep all attendees safe. Bottom line, use common sense when packing any bags to bring into the BYOC area.
