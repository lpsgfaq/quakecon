General FAQ - LAN Party Setup Guide (Quakecon v.2023)
by Michael "DeusEx" OHara

Step 1 - Windows!

 If you're bringing a PC; Try to follow the flow for installing your OS if you're doing a clean Windows install before the con:
 OS → Updates (Windows 11 downloads these automatically typically before first system use) → Hardware Drivers → Browser → Misc Software (Spotify/Discord) → Games
 Over the past four FAQs, I’ve recommended Macrium Reflect. Due to Macrium no longer offering a free edition starting with version 8.0, Macrium Reflect is no longer recommended for this FAQ; and NTLite will be recommended in its place to help minimize downtime during Windows installs.

 Step 2 - Games!
 
 If you are doing a clean install of your games before the con, it normally goes in this order:
 Distribution Service → Games → Mods (where applicable). Most game launchers will have dedicated verification, repair, and install location tools, with the Epic Games Launcher having current support for these items on a per-game basis. For consoles, it's a much simpler process.

 Step 3 - Getting Your PC/Console To the Con and Securing It!

Here are some personal tips that I can recommend:

For Quakecon 2023, it is currently unknown which process will be used for hardware check-in/check-out. This FAQ will be updated closer to the event when details are publicly available for dissemination. The general consensus currently is that the check-in system from previous years will return.
If you plan on bringing either a laptop or a gaming console, please make sure there is a spot on the device for a Kensington Lock. The tables at the BYOC should support this security method; and the same policies above will apply.
Please lock your computer while you are away, and take your XBox/Playstation controllers with you (this doubly applies to attendees bringing a console). If you don't, your screen saver (or game dashboard) will almost certainly have some form of pr0n on it. You have been warned. 
In regards to Internet, the event will provide a internet connection; but an Ethernet cord of at least 50ft and of Cat6E quality or better should be in your belongings.
Make friends on the same row as you and toss them a Bawls or two if you want them to look after your belongings. You know, the whole squeaky wheel gets the grease kinda thing ...


 Step 4 - Something is Fucked. Literally.

 Say it with me everybody:
 “If it works before you left for Quakecon, there’s a chance it’ll stop working during Quakecon.”

 The last in-person con had a on-site vendor to buy replacement parts from. Due to Quakecon 2023 not having a Exhibit Hall, in the circumstance you need a replacement part (and the on-site vendor does not return); there is a Micro Center located in Richardson, about 20-25 minutes away by car with little/no traffic. To get there, you’ll exit the Gaylord onto TX-26, then merge onto I-635 Eastbound. You’ll exit onto 75 North, and you’ll be on Northbound 75 for a couple mins; and take the Spring Valley exit (Exit 23). U-Turn onto the service road for 75 South, and you’ll see Micro Center on your right-hand side.

 Step 5 - Cleaning your PC

 A couple of weeks before the con, and again before you tear down your PC to bring it to the con, make sure to give it a good cleaning! (Also, clean your mouse and keyboard; you filthy monsters FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S HOLY). The PC cleaning can generally be accomplished with either an ESD-free vacuum or a leaf blower. If you use the leaf blower though, make sure to keep your case fans from spinning; otherwise, you will put a lot of unnecessary wear on them, leading to them potentially failing during a gaming session at the con.


 Step 6 - Entering the BYOC

 You will be asked to open your bags/purses upon entering the BYOC to inspect for any dangerous items by volunteers with the Bag Check team. This team, along with uniformed and plain-clothes deputies from the Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office want to keep all attendees safe. Bottom line, use common sense when packing any bags to bring into the BYOC area. Tl;dr: Use common sense and don't have anything in your bag that can get you arrested.
